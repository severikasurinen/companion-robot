# Companion Robot

The code and schematics were made for a companion robot project.

To upload the code to your Arduino, download the folder above and open the code inside with Arduino IDE.

Press the button until you hear a long beep to turn the robot on and get out of the radar's view for the first full rotation so the initial distances are correct. To turn the robot off, hold the button until you hear a long beep.
